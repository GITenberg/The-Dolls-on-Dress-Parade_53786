_Song Specialties for Your Entertainments_


Teachers are discovering that no matter how much novelty there is in
their entertainment, how well it is arranged, how thoroughly drilled,
if they want to hold the active interest of the audience they must use
the best of songs. The songs must be real novelties. The words must be
interesting as well as decidedly clever. The music must be catchy and
abounding in rich melody. With these things in mind we have prepared
this list of superior song novelties for our patrons. All are in
regular sheet music form.

(_Child enters._)

CHILD:

    I’m looking for a dollie
      And so I’ve come to you.
    I’m told that you have in your store
      Some lovely dolls quite new.

    I hope they all are home today
      And every one I’ll see.
    I’ll choose the very nicest
      And take her home with me.

SHOP WOMAN:

    My dear, I’ll show you many dolls
      All in their best arrayed,
    Because today, you lucky girl,
      They have a dress parade.

CHILD:

A dress parade—how lovely!

SHOP WOMAN:

    I hear their tiny shoes.
      This soldier doll announces them.
    You’ll find it hard to choose.

[_SOLDIER DOLL sticks head in door off stage._]

SOLDIER DOLL:

    All ready. There’s a child out here
      Who wants a doll I think.
    But do not wait another bit.
      You’ve all had time to prink.

[_Child shows delight as each doll enters._]

[_SOLDIER DOLL announces dolls as they enter._]

RAG DOLLS:

    We are such very useful dolls
      I’m sure you must agree
    That for the children everyday
      No dolls are good as we.

    We’re washable, we never break,
      We bend quite anyway.
    Just try us for a year or two,
      We are the best you’ll say.

FRENCH DOLL:

    I am an aristocrat,
      A doll of high degree.
    I came to you from far away
      In France across the sea.

    My name is ISABELLA,
      I’m a most expensive doll
    So you must treat me gently
      And never let me fall.
    I shut my eyes so nicely
      Just tilt me back and see.

[_SHOP WOMAN tilts her and her eyes close._]

    Now, isn’t that a clever trick?
      I’m sure you will like me.

FARMER DOLL:

    I’m a FARMER DOLL
      See my rake and hoe.
    I can plant your garden
      And all the seeds will grow.

    I’m so very useful
      I can rake the hay
    And mow the wheat when it gets ripe.
      I’m busy all the day.

PAPER DOLL:

    I’m only made of paper
      And cheap as cheap can be.
    I don’t belong in this parade,
      But still, you _might_ like me.

    My dresses, colored paper,
      You’d find it fun to make.
    In fact, unless you take _me_ home
      You’ll make a sad mistake.

BABY DOLL:

    Cunning baby doll am I
      Pinch me and I cry
    Loudly for my parents,
      Don’t you want to try?

[_SHOP WOMAN pinches her and she cries._]

SAILOR DOLL:

    I’m Jack Tar, a sailor doll
      Just off the salty sea.
    And every girl in every port
      Was very fond of me.

    I’ve traveled over all the world
      It’s made me very clever,
    A doll of my experience
      You’ll seldom find if ever.

[_Dances Sailor’s Hornpipe._]

COLLAPSIBLE DOLLS:

    Push down our heads,—
      When we arise
    We’ll loudly squawk
      To your surprise.

    We all collapse
      And squawk, each one.
    The children think us
      Lots of fun.

[_SHOP WOMAN pushes down head of each one and it squawks as it rises._]

JAPANESE DOLL:

    My name is Lotus Flower
      I came from far Japan.
    Just look at my kimono
      And my flirtatious fan.

    I’ll tell of cherry blossoms,
      Of feasts of long ago,
    Of temple bells a-ringing.
      Where paper lanterns glow.

    I’ll bow to you politely
      And drink a lot of tea.
    I’ll honorably serve you,
      So, please, I beg, take me.

DUTCH DOLL:

    I’m Huldah from Holland,
      With stout wooden shoes,
    Most any wise child
      Would a Dutch dolly choose.

    I never get dirty
      I smile as I play
    I know you’ll soon love me,
      So take me today.

INDIAN DOLL:

    My name is Laughing Water,
      And your papoose I’ll be
    Just hang my deerskin cradle
      To sway in any tree.

    Build me a little wigwam
      Where I may sleep at night,
    And sing me Indian lullabies
      When stars are shining bright.

    You never need be careful
      But leave me in the sun.
    My wax is very solid,
      My colors never run.

ESKIMO DOLL:

    I’m a hardy Eskimo
      From the land of ice and snow
    What a lovely doll I’d be
      In the winter, don’t you see?

    Cuddle me beneath your arm,
      And my fur will keep you warm.
    In the snow drifts we will play
      With rosy cheeks and voices gay.

_All dolls sing—Air: COMIN’ THRU THE RYE._


1.

    If a girlie needs a dollie
      Made for fun and play,
    If the dollie must be lovely
      Girlie, look this way.

_Chorus:_

    Every girlie needs a dollie,
      None you say have you,
    So smile on me, my pretty maid,
      Oh, don’t you think I’ll do?

2.

    I’ve a nature kind and loving,
      Very seldom cry,
    Never frowning, always smiling,
      Do not pass me by.


3.

    When a girlie needs a dollie
      Why the search delay?
    Here am I all ready, waiting,
      Choose me now, today.

_Enter OLD DOLL._

    My name is Mary Alice,
      And I’m old as old can be.
    My paint’s washed off, my head is cracked,
      No little girl wants me.

    My hair was once in golden curls
      And now it hangs forlorn,
    My eyes are dim from crying,
      My pretty dress is torn.

    I only came to see the rest.
      Of course I did not dream
    That any child could care for me,
      So shabby now I seem. [_Weeps._]

CHILD:

    Oh, Mary Alice, please don’t cry.
      I want you, I choose _you_.
    I’ll love you much, much better
      Than these dainty dolls so new.
    They’ll find a home at once, I’m sure,
      But you, my dear, need me.

    [_To audience_] I’ve made a wise selection

    I’m sure you all agree.
      For after all old friends are best,
    Friends that are tried and true.
      And so from all the Dolls Parade
    Dear Mary Alice, I choose you.

OLD DOLL:

    You make me very happy.
      I can scarce believe my ears—
    To think that you will take _me_ home
      And not those lovely dears.

    Their clothes are fresh and dainty,
      Their cheeks are painted red,
    Their locks are long and curling,
      While mine are straight instead.

    But, though I’m old and faded
      My heart beats warm and true—
    I’ll always, always, grateful be
      Dear little girl to you.

All the other dolls—in amazement—

    She’s going to take MARY ALICE?
      It really can’t be true—

[_To MARY ALICE._]

    With all of us so beautiful
      She wouldn’t look at you.

[_To CHILD._]

    Just look again at us we beg.
      You must have failed to see
    Our shining curls, our dresses new,
      Our pride and dignity.

    You surely don’t want that old doll!
      She’s been worn out for years.
    You’ll change your mind when you get home
      And hurry back in tears.

    And then you’ll find we all are gone
      With other little girls
    Who like our style, our pretty clothes,
      Our lovely flowing curls.

SAILOR DOLL (_stepping to front and motioning rest to be still_):

    She’s right. I know, for I am wise;
    Although it is to my surprise
    She shows such sense, for little girls
    Are always pleased by silly curls.

    They fail to see, ’neath raiment gay
    A spirit that is sweet and gay.
    This child is most as wise as I.
    She knows it’s best to pass _us_ by

    And choose, a doll for every day,
    A doll that’s had long years of play,
    Is beautiful in this child’s eyes.
    She’s right. _I_ know, and I am wise.

    And if the choice seems queer to you
    Because you’re all so fresh and new,
    I’ve traveled over sea and land,
    I’m wise, at least _I_ understand.
    You’d only be an honored guest.
    In dolls—or friends—the old are best.

ALL: Well, perhaps you are right. It’s nice for Mary Alice, any way,
isn’t it!

_All sing—Air: AULD LANG SYNE._

    Old dolls are like old friends the best
      Because they’re tried and true
    But we’ll be old dolls, too, some day,
      Instead of fine and new.

_Chorus:_

    And you will love us then
      When beauties fade,
    The dolls you’re passing by today,
      The dolls on dress parade.

Dolls parade off stage, followed by SOLDIER DOLL, and led by the SAILOR
DOLL. CHILD stands with arms around MARY ALICE as curtain goes down.
Guests leave.

intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
